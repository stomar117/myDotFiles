These are my configurations and themes for my setup of arch linux, and nothing else.

## Requirements

### Note:
- For both vim and nvim run `:PluginInstall` and `:PluginUpdate` in the vim command mode for everything to work properly.

- For tmux please refer to [this](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) and [this](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/ports/tmux/installation) link if you want to use my config also the key bindings for selecting and pasting are adjusted to suite the vim bindings for ease of use.
